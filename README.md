# Transient-Execution-Attacks
Repository describing Proof of Concepts (POCs) of some Transient Execution Attacks (i.e., Spectre and Meltdown)

This work is a combination of other publicly available Proof of Concepts (POCs) of Transient Execution Attacks, specifically Spectre and Meltdown attacks.

Links to the original work can be found in the README files of each folder.

The purpose of this project is to try to create a common repository for these types of attacks and hopefully build upon the original work in a meaningful manner.
